At its core, this function is just a simple random number generator and based on that number the function will output whether the user should get a cat or a dog as a pet. 

When running the function, the user inputs an integer which will act as the upper boundary for the potential number that is randomly sampled (1:x, ie if you input 10 the range will be 1-10). Ths inputted number can be infinently high it just must be an integer.

Using the sample function, the code will then select a single number within the specified range and then if that number is even it will return the user should get a dog and if its odd a cat.
